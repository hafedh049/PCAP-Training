Tuples in Python are **immutable sequences**, which means that once a tuple is created, its **elements cannot be changed**. Because of this **immutability**, tuples have fewer methods compared to mutable sequences like lists. Here's a list of all the methods available for tuples:

### Tuple Methods

1. **`tuple.count(x)`**
   - Returns the number of times `x` appears in the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4)
   print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 3
   ```

2. **`tuple.index(x[, start[, end]])`**
   - Returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the tuple. Raises a `ValueError` if `x` is not found. The optional arguments `start` and `end` restrict the search to a particular subsequence of the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4)
   print(my_tuple.index(2))  # Output: 1
   print(my_tuple.index(2, 2, len(my_tuple)))  # Output: 3 (start searching from index 2)
   ```

### Built-in Functions Applicable to Tuples

Apart from the methods specific to tuples, several built-in functions can be used with tuples, as they are applicable to any sequence type:

1. **`len()`**
   - Returns the number of items in the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   print(len(my_tuple))  # Output: 3
   ```

2. **`max()`**
   - Returns the largest item in the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   print(max(my_tuple))  # Output: 3
   ```

3. **`min()`**
   - Returns the smallest item in the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   print(min(my_tuple))  # Output: 1
   ```

4. **`sum()`**
   - Returns the sum of the items in the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   print(sum(my_tuple))  # Output: 6
   ```

5. **`sorted()`**
   - Returns a sorted list of the tuple's elements.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (3, 1, 2)
   print(sorted(my_tuple))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
   ```

6. **`all()`**
   - Returns `True` if all elements of the tuple are true (or if the tuple is empty).

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   print(all(my_tuple))  # Output: True

   my_tuple = (0, 1, 2)
   print(all(my_tuple))  # Output: False (0 is considered False)
   ```

7. **`any()`**
   - Returns `True` if any element of the tuple is true. If the tuple is empty, returns `False`.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (0, 1, 2)
   print(any(my_tuple))  # Output: True

   my_tuple = (0, 0, 0)
   print(any(my_tuple))  # Output: False
   ```

8. **`enumerate()`**
   - Returns an enumerate object. It contains the index and value of all the items in the tuple as pairs.

```python
   my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c')
   
   for index, value in enumerate(my_tuple, 00):
       print(index, value)
       
   # Output:
   # 0 a
   # 1 b
   # 2 c
```

9. **`reversed()`**
   - Returns a reverse iterator over the elements of the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   print(list(reversed(my_tuple)))  # Output: [3, 2, 1]
   ```
